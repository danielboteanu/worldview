The Nimbus Horizontal Convective Roll layer is a visual representation of the evaluations of a machine learning model trained to scan satellite imagery and detect the presence of cloud streets, or "horizontal convective rolls". While an experienced individual may take just a second or two to determine whether an image contains cloud streets or not, Nimbus can evaluate an image in less than 100 microseconds, or 1/100th of a millisecond. 

Cloud streets occur at intersections of rising warm air and sinking cool air in the atmosphere. Warm, moist air rises into the atmosphere, cools, and condenses, resulting in the formation of clouds. Cool air sinks, and does not form clouds. When cold air is found to sink where warm air is rising and forming clouds, along with sufficient wind turbulence, cloud streets occur. This is because the cold air remains cloudless beside horizontal stretches of warm, cloudy air, in a repetitive, alternating manner.

While one could simply increase the magnification of the map, and detect cloud streets through observation, our machine learning model operates significantly faster, and at a rate of 80% accuracy. These results are combined to form this user-friendly visual layer, which facilitates observation of highly likely occurrences of cloud streets across the planet - without the need to view and inspect thousands of individual satellite images.
