The SpaceBoys Horizontal Convective Roll layer is a visual representation of the findings of a machine learning model trained to scan satellite imagery and detect the presence of cloud streets, or "horizontal convective rolls". Cloud streets occur as the result of rising warm air and sinking cool air. Warm air rises into the atmosphere, and when warm, moist air cools and condenses, clouds form. Cool air sinks, and does not form clouds - when cold air is found to sink where warm air is rising and forming clouds, cloud streets occur.

While one could simply increase the magnification of the map, and detect cloud streets through observation, our machine learning model operates significantly faster (about 93 microseconds per image), at a rate of 80% accuracy. These results are combined to form this simple visual layer, which allows users observation of cloud streets across the planet without the need to view hundreds or thousands of individual satellite images.
